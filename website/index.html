            <h3 class="faq-question">What is TrueBlocks Key?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                TrueBlocks Key is an old-fashioned Web 2.0 that solves the same problem<br>
                as TrueBlocks Core, but does so through an AWS-based Web API. This<br>
                makes it easy to use, but it also means we will capture your data and use<br>
                it for our own purposes. In that sense, it's not Web 3.0 at all. Your<br>
                call though.

            <h3 class="faq-question">What is TrueBlocks Core?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                TrueBlocks Core is a 100% local-first, fully-open source EVM-compatible<br>
                blockchain indexing solution. It runs on your laptop without relience on<br>
                any third-party (including us!).

            <h3 class="faq-question">I thought TrueBlocks was anti-Web 2.0. What's up?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">We were never anti- anything. We always tried to<br>
                make the the point that building the hard part (i.e. the decentralized<br>
                part) should be done first. We've done that. It's called TrueBlocks Core.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">Is TrueBlocks shifting its focus away from decentralization?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                No, TrueBlocks remains committed to decentralization. The introduction of TrueBlocks<br>
                Key is part of our effort to provide users with diverse options for their specific<br>
                needs. TrueBlocks Core, with its 100% local-first and decentralized nature, remains at the<br>
                heart of our commitment to empowering users with secure and independent blockchain solutions.
